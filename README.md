### Bank-Identification-Number ( Get BIN Issuer Info )

The BIN (short for bank identification number) consists of the first six digits of a credit card number. It indicates the bank that has issued the card. It is also commonly referred to as the “issuer identification number” (IIN), since banks aren't the only institutions that issue credit cards.
